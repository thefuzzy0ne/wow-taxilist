## Taxi List


Attaches a sorted, <u>searchable</u> list of available taxi points to the Flight/Ferry Master frame, complete with travel costs.

Useful for people who struggle to find taxi destination points by name, or simply as a time-saver because you're time is important or you are just too lazy to do it the usual way.

When you hover over a taxi destination in the list, the appropriate icon on the map is highlighted, so you can see where you will be travelling to.
